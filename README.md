<h1>Dice Game</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project is my second JavaScript project, where I focused on building a <strong>Dice Game</strong>. The game is designed for two players and revolves around rolling dice, accumulating scores, and racing to reach a 100-point target. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript and game logic.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>While working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript Functions:</strong> Writing and organizing functions to handle game mechanics.</li>
        <li><strong>DOM Manipulation:</strong> Interacting with the web page to update the game state dynamically.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Logic Development:</strong> Creating the rules and flow of the game, including rolling dice, holding scores, and resetting the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Responding to user interactions, such as button clicks, to drive the game.</li>
        <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Managing and updating the gameâ€™s state, including current scores and active players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>New Game:</strong> Resets all scores and sets the game to its initial state.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> Generates a random number between 1 and 6 for the active player and updates the current score.</li>
        <li><strong>Hold:</strong> Allows the active player to save their current score to their total, switching turns and moving closer to the 100-point goal.</li>
        <li>The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.</li>
    </ol>
